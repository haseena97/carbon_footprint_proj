# Analysis of Carbon Footprint in the Logostics Industry: Project Overview
- Created a web app that allow client to predict their annual carbon footprint based on their vehicles' fuel consumption and other variables.
- Plot permutation importance plot to identify major contributors to carbon emission.
- Optimized linear and tree-based models using GridsearchCV to reach the best model with least MAE score.
- Built a client facing API using flask and host on Heroku.
- Provide solutions for each contributors to carbon emission.
